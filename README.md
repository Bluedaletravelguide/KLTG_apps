- New event screen added

## Getting Started

Here are some tips for using Flutter & instructions for this project: 
-Usually, we separate the code because it will increase the overall performance.

Of course, you mostly going to work with the lib folder the rest folder are for the backend development
We separated the app into four main folders the lib folder is divided as follow:
 
    1- Data folder, which contains the data. 
    2- Models folder, contain the project classes & the AdSense code.
    3- Screen folder, contain the actual screen displayed on the phone.
    4- Widget folder, contain the widgets, those widgets then have been called into the screen. 
    lastly the main file. This file contains the font, colour theming and the app run function.

More details of the functions and the code added into the code.

## Updates
Due to ads annoyance, we removed the ad that goes full screen, and replaced it with banner ads.

## Updates2

We have added a new home screen upon launching the app as well as search engine for users to search and obtain the content neccessary based on their query. More info on the code functionalities can be found in search_screen.dart and home_screen.dart respectively. On top of that, these features are implemented across all other apps.

## Updates3

We have added 5 new functionalties throughout the apps. These include:
Bookmark, which is locally saved into the device storage.
Crossword, more to come soon as this is just the first version.
Introduction screen, which is for first time users for the app.
Push Notification, for engagement purposes via Firebase.
Home screen; this is a minor adjustment based on the first home screen before update 2.
Also, firebase_admob package is depreciated at April 2021, so we have migrated to google_mobile_ads for future proofing.

Additionally, this new version has the minimum compile SDK version bumped on to 19 for Android and 10.0 in iOS in order to accomodate these new packages and features.
